Hi 👋

I'm a Java developer focused on backend development and building clean, reliable, and maintainable software systems.

Currently working as a Java Developer Intern, where I’m learning how real-world backend systems are written, tested, documented, and maintained.

### What I focus on
- Core Java and backend logic
- Writing clean and readable code
- Code documentation using JavaDoc
- Unit testing with JUnit
- Understanding and improving existing codebases

### How I use GitHub
I use GitHub to share:
- Small backend-focused projects
- Code examples and experiments
- Clean implementations of concepts I’m learning

Always learning, improving, and writing better code.
